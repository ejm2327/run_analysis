Project Requirements The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Details of the Data

‘README.txt’

‘features_info.txt’: Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

‘features.txt’<- features: List of all features.

‘activity_labels.txt’ <- activities: Links the class labels with their activity name.

‘subject_test.txt’ <- subject test: Data of volunteers for test data being observed

‘subject_train.txt’ <- subject train: Data of volunteers for training data being observed

‘train/X_train.txt’ <- x_train: Training set.

‘train/y_train.txt’ <- y_train: Training labels.

‘test/X_test.txt’ <- x_test: Test set.

‘test/y_test.txt’ <- x_test: Test labels

Steps followed in analysis
Data downloaded from the URL

Variables (as mentioned above) assigned.

Merged the data using rbind and cbind functions into one data set called FinalData

Assigned descriptive names to each column using gsub function.

Created an independent new data called MainData, which contains the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Exported the data into 'tidydata.txt'file.
